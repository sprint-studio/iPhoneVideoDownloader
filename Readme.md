   _Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content_.

## Troubleshooting

- **Device not detected?**
  - Make sure your iPhone is unlocked and you have tapped "Trust this Computer".
  - Your iPhone should show up in the macOS “Image Capture” app as well.
- **No videos shown?**
  - Ensure there are videos in your Camera Roll (not just iCloud placeholders).
- **Permissions issues?**
  - On first run, macOS may request Photos or Files access. Approve these.
